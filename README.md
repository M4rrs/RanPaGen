A Random Password Generator

Such came the question of how a random password generator works.
And so I decided to make one myself.
Probably missing a lot of other things that could help generate a stronger, safer password.
But it works, so I think it's good enough for now.

#### To Run Dev Mode
`npm start` in `RanPaGen/app`

#### Plans to improve
- Option to copy generated password
